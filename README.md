experiment with footers while learning css


this is my first attempt at designing something with beginner css knowledge, i wanted to design something to eventually fit my wild foraging website 
my partner had requested. 

im happy overall with the result although will make some changes before applying to the wild foraging website like tuning up the sizing of the social links
and colour.

i tried to really test myself on this but i did use a reference list when needed but found it was for things like flex.wrap instead of flex-wrap and border.box 
instead of border-box. i am currently learning C# along side and feel the Console.WriteLine and Convert.ToDouble commands for example may have played a part in
those mistakes.
